<p> Only 8 am and already the heat of summer could be felt in the room. It has been already an hour that I am half-awake - this damn early sunrises in this part of the world, possibly one of the things that annoy me the most. That and having to wake up summer day after summer day for a few seconds at 5.30 am to lower the curtains and avoid all sunlight from invading my room. Who can't sleep in an environment filled with sunlight?</p><p> At least the sound of the sea brings that much required inner peace and tranquility that every man longs for. At least for a few seconds. At least while your eyes are closed. </p><p>I used to wake up to a good cup of coffee. Freshly ground, the smell of that marvelous Colombian coffee would bring me back to those peaceful days where the worries were less. Some times I would wonder if feelings in the world behaved like waves in the sea. A rippling effect that would end up in a harmonious balance, once the storm had parted. Happiness to one would bring sadness to another. Anxiety for some, peace and relaxation for others. And in this way, life and the future of the human being would always be what it had been until then, a roller coaster. </p><p>The financial crisis had brought this anxiety to me. Free from worry, I used to see, feel and experience life from a purely positive pole. "There may be bumps, but at the end everything works out". Life with no worries, life with no real planning, life blindfolded, without having a firm grasp of the reins. But filled with positiveness simply because the negative had never been experienced. Nobody had bruised my face, nobody had kicked in the ass. Things had just worked out and when things work out, nobody ever stops and thinks why they do. And in my case, it wasn't because of my own efforts and achievements but rather by sheer trust and confidence and expectation that there would only be one way - the good way. It was a careless attitude, typical from a youngster with a laxed attitude. Extrapolated, maybe, to the rest of the world pre-2008. Could this be what people had become? Could the man in the shadows realised and said "enough"? </p><p>After losing my clothing business and feeling the burden of debt and a family of 4 to support, my breathing had deteriorated. After 7 or 8 exhalations, I was forced to inhale deeply - it was a feeling like somebody had sucked out most of the oxygen in the room and my lungs had to make an effort to get as much in as possible. 
 I could hardly sleep at nights and I started to feel miserable. The relationship with my wife was deteriorating and even herself started feeling the pressure. </p><p>But then, once I had hit rock-bottom, something happened. Family helped out. I managed to get my loans re-financed after over a year of long nights caused by anxiety and migraines. But it was done and all thanks to the support of family. I look now in retrospect and realise that despite my careless actions and lack of back up plan, somebody had been there by my side the whole time. Somebody wanted to teach me a lesson but at the same time, wanted things to "work out", just like I always had so foolishly expected. </p><p>With the sun rays hitting my eyes through the curtains and the temperature in the room rising above the accepted threshold for a human to sleep, I woke up to the sound of the sea. Now it was peace and tranquility again - but this time, with a strong sense of realisation and appreciation. I walk out of the bedroom and into the yard outside. The smell of jazmin is still perceivable despite being morning. I can hear the kids playing in the swimming pool and the view over the west side of the Troodos mountains is breathtaking. New plans need to be made for the future. But for now, for this week, it is summer and tranquility reigns.   </p><p>Remember. You are the driver. You have to be in control of your life and feel that you do. Do not look for excuses and do not expect anybody to come and resolve your problems. If you feel bad, speak up. Go to a friend, to a colleague, to a psychologist, to a family member, to whoever you think is best. But act. When you don't act or you don't talk, you are also taking a decision, just possibly the one you would not like to take. Every situation has a solution, so when you wake up in the morning, freshen up, try to wear something that gives you confidence, that matches who you are and that is suited to your profession. When you finish work, give yourself an hour to do something that you usually don't do and that you would like to do. Break from that sad routine that keeps you mentally enslaved and realise the opportunity. For every door that closes, another one opens. </p><p>Measure your decisions with the care and attention that they require - for it is your life and that of your loved ones at stake. And yes, you are the driver and yes, you can change things. Don't let life overboard you. Realise that your decisions have consequences and try to understand what those consequences are. And act. </p><p>And when you talk, feel that you are being true to yourself. Ensure your thoughts are aligned with what you say. When you put your thoughts into meaningful words and those words become actions that faithfully represent the meaning behind the words, you will be in harmony with  with the world.  </p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">A sunny day </a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
